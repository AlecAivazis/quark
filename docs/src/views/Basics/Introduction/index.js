            Quark is a component library designed to be used in both `React` and `ReactNative` in
            order to provide one single vocabulary for building interfaces. Along with common visual
            components, it also has powerful state management components, useful for quickly
            building complex state in a composable manner.
        </Description>
        <Description textStyle={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
            To get started, please read the `Getting Started` guide on the left. The components
            under the `Components` section can be used in either `quark-native` or `quark-core`,
            unless the component is specifically tagged for one or the either.
