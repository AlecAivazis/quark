This components designates the location for alerts that fall under a designated namespace.

Alerts can have different semantic meaning and are meant to provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions. They are triggered using the `triggerAlert` function and can have 3 types: `warning`, `info` and `success`.

Please note, there is a bug currently in the documentation site that prevents the inner message to grow and shrink to push the close icon to the far right. In your app the close icon should be all the way to the side.
